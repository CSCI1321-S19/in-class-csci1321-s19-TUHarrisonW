How to use my mud.

Start up:
1) Run the mud like normal. 
2) On the same terminal/console where it was run type "start"
3) Wait till it says "Server is now open"
4) Play like normal (can network in & play)


Things to know:
1) The admin (where mud file was run / where user typed "start") can not play like a normal player
		in order to play a client must connect in.
2)PVP is not allowed. Only NPCs can be attacked.

tip:
1) Don't attack the heralds
2) Don't attack king_lewis
3) You have a starting inventory.
